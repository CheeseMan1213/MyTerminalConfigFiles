# MyTerminalConfigFiles
In this git repository, I will be storing the various configuration files that I would use to configure things such as Vim and other terminal configuration files.

Vim commands:
Added by me to the .vimrc file.
jj = and alternative to pressing the escape key.

Vim default: (while in normal mode.)
h = Left
j = Down
k = Up
l = Right
x = deletes single characcher at position of cursor.
Shift-v = enters select mode and automatically selects the whole line.
Ctrl-v = allows you to select more granularly by character
Shift-[ = Up by a block
Shift-] = Down by a block
d = delete selected text (Note this is 'cut')
dd = delete the line you are currently on (Note this is 'cut')  
u = undo
Ctrl-r = redo
i = enters insert mode
a = enters insert mode, but one spot ahead (this might be the one you use the most.) 
o = enters insert mode, and automatically puts you on a new line, one line below
O = enters insert mode, and automatically puts you on a new line, one line above
Shift-g = Snaps to bottom of page.
gg = Snaps to the top of page.
Shift-6 = this one can be seen generally as snap in to the beginning of the current line but more specifically it is actually jumping to the first non-white space character of the line, for example if you were to have tabs or spaces at the beginning of the line then this key binding would not technically take you to the beginning of the line but to the beginning of the first word.
number zero = snap to the beginning of the current line.
Shift-5 = (prerequiset = be on some sort of brace) automatically jump between the open and close brace.
zz = Centers your view
When he was talking about the 'zz' key binding, he did not mean zz takes you to the center of the doc, he meant zz centers the cursor on the page where you currently at.
